# Task Description

## Task definition

College life can be a whirlwind sometimes, balancing both studies and social life.
What's better than relaxing after a week full of
assignments and classes with a great cocktail shared
with your friends?
Imagine having a fun, easy-to-use app on your phone
that helps you mix up tasty drinks on a student budget.
Your task is to create a Cocktail recipe book app.
Let's shake things up together!

2. Preview of details info about every cocktail:
   
   - The cocktail name, image, a list of ingredients, and preparation
instructions.

variant (you can also favourite them).
